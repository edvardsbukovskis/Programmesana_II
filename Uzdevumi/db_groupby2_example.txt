Exercise 1:
Group games by their platform and calculate the average user rating for each platform.

Exercise 2:
Group games by rounded user ratings and count the number of games in each rating category.

Exercise 3:
Group games by platform and then by their rounded user ratings. Count how many games in each rating category exist for each platform.
