Scenario 1: Library Management System
Specific Task Description:

Tables and Attributes:

Books: Attributes include BookID, ISBN, Title, PublicationYear, Genre.
Copies: Attributes include CopyID, BookID, ConditionStatus.
Authors: Attributes include AuthorID, Name, Biography.
BookAuthors: This is a junction table to handle the many-to-many relationship between Books and Authors.
Patrons: Attributes include PatronID, Name, MembershipDate.
Loans: Attributes include LoanID, CopyID, PatronID, LoanDate, DueDate, ReturnDate.
Relationships:

Books to Copies: One-to-many (Each book can have multiple copies).
Books to Authors through BookAuthors: Many-to-many (A book can have multiple authors and an author can write multiple books).
Patrons to Loans: One-to-many (A patron can have multiple loans, but each loan is associated with only one patron).
Copies to Loans: One-to-one (Each copy can be on one loan at a time).
Implementation Hints:

Students should determine the primary keys for each table (like BookID, AuthorID, etc.).
Students should figure out which attributes should be foreign keys to link tables together (for example, CopyID in Loans references CopyID in Copies).
The junction table BookAuthors should include BookID and AuthorID as foreign keys, and the combination should be unique to prevent duplicate pairings.
