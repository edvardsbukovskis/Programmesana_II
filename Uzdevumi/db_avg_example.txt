-- Creating the 'movies' table
CREATE TABLE movies (
    movie_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    director TEXT NOT NULL,
    release_year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    rating DECIMAL(3,1) NOT NULL, -- Rating out of 10, e.g., 7.8
    box_office_earnings INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Inserting some sample data into the 'movies' table
WITH RECURSIVE movie_gen AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id + 1 FROM movie_gen WHERE id < 35
)
INSERT INTO movies (title, director, release_year, rating, box_office_earnings)
SELECT 
    'Movie ' || id, 
    'Director ' || ((id - 1) % 7 + 1), 
    1990 + (id % 30), 
    (RANDOM() % 6 + 5) * 0.1,  -- Random rating between 5.0 to 10.0
    1000000 * id 
FROM movie_gen;
