Beginner Level Exercise: Modeling a Simple Library Book

Problem:
Create a class Book that represents a book in a library system. The class should have the following attributes:
title: The title of the book.
author: The author of the book.
isbn: The ISBN number of the book.

Implement the following methods:

__init__: Initializes the title, author, and isbn attributes.
__repr__: Returns a string representation of the book in the format:
"Book-The Great Gatsby, author-F. Scott Fitzgerald, isbn-1234567890"

Tasks:
Define the Book class with the specified attributes and methods.
Create an instance of Book with the title "To Kill a Mockingbird", author "Harper Lee", and ISBN "9780060935467".
Print the instance to see its string representation.



Medium Level Exercise: Designing a Vehicle Hierarchy

Problem:
You are designing a system to manage different types of vehicles for a transportation company.
Create a base class Vehicle with the following:

Attributes:
make: The manufacturer of the vehicle.
model: The model of the vehicle.
year: The production year of the vehicle.
Methods:
__init__: Initializes the make, model, and year.
__repr__: Returns a string representation of the vehicle.

Then, create two subclasses Car and Truck that inherit from Vehicle.

For Car:
Additional Attribute:
number_of_doors: Number of doors in the car.
Methods:
Override __repr__ to include number_of_doors.

For Truck:
Additional Attribute:
payload_capacity: Maximum payload capacity in tons.
Methods:
Override __repr__ to include payload_capacity.

Tasks:
Define the Vehicle base class.
Define the Car and Truck subclasses with their additional attributes and overridden methods.
Create an instance of Car and Truck, and print them to see their representations.



Advanced Level Exercise: Building an Employee Management System

Problem:
Develop an employee management system for a company that includes different types of employees.

Create a base class Employee with:
Attributes:
name: The employee's name.
employee_id: Unique identifier for the employee.
salary: The base salary of the employee.
Methods:
__init__: Initializes the name, employee_id, and salary.
__repr__: Returns a string representation of the employee.
calculate_pay(): Returns the salary (to be overridden in subclasses if needed).
Then, create subclasses Manager, Engineer, and Intern that inherit from Employee.

For Manager:
Additional Attribute:
bonus: Annual bonus amount.
Methods:
Override calculate_pay() to include the bonus.
For Engineer:

Additional Attribute:
specialty: The engineering specialty (e.g., 'Software', 'Mechanical').
Methods:
Use the base calculate_pay() method.
For Intern:

Additional Attribute:
school: The school the intern is attending.
Methods:
Override calculate_pay() to return half the salary.

Tasks:
Define the Employee base class.
Define the Manager, Engineer, and Intern subclasses with their specific attributes and methods.
Override the calculate_pay() method in subclasses where necessary.
Create instances of each subclass and demonstrate the calculate_pay() method.
Print the employee details using __repr__.




Extra - Advanced Level Exercise: Creating a Hospital Management System
Problem:

Develop a hospital management system that models patients, medical staff, and appointments.

Classes to Create:

Person (Base Class)

Attributes:
name: The person's full name.
age: The person's age.
gender: The person's gender.
Methods:
__init__: Initializes the name, age, and gender.
__repr__: Returns a string representation of the person.

Patient (Subclass of Person)
Additional Attributes:
patient_id: Unique identifier for the patient.
ailments: List of ailments the patient has.
appointments: List of Appointment objects.
Methods:
add_ailment(ailment): Adds an ailment to the patient's list.
schedule_appointment(appointment): Adds an appointment to the patient's schedule.
Override __repr__ to include patient_id and ailments.

Staff (Subclass of Person)
Attributes:
staff_id: Unique identifier for the staff member.
department: Department where the staff member works.
Methods:
__init__: Initializes all attributes, including those from Person.
Override __repr__ to include staff_id and department.

Doctor (Subclass of Staff)
Additional Attributes:
specialization: Medical specialization (e.g., 'Cardiology', 'Neurology').
patients: List of Patient objects assigned to the doctor.
Methods:
add_patient(patient): Adds a patient to the doctor's list.
Override __repr__ to include specialization.

Nurse (Subclass of Staff)
Additional Attributes:
shift: The nurse's working shift (e.g., 'Day', 'Night').
Methods:
Override __repr__ to include shift.

Appointment
Attributes:
appointment_id: Unique identifier for the appointment.
patient: The Patient object.
doctor: The Doctor object.
date: The date of the appointment.
time: The time of the appointment.
Methods:
__init__: Initializes all attributes.
__repr__: Returns a string representation of the appointment.

Tasks:
Define all classes with their respective attributes and methods.
Implement inheritance where appropriate, ensuring proper initialization using super().
Override methods (__repr__) to provide meaningful string representations.
Create instances of Patient, Doctor, Nurse, and Appointment.
Simulate interactions:
Add ailments to patients.
Schedule appointments between patients and doctors.
Assign patients to doctors.
Print out details of patients, staff, and appointments to demonstrate the functioning of the system.
