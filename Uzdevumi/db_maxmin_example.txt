-- Creating the 'books' table
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    author TEXT NOT NULL,
    publication_year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    sales INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Inserting some sample data into the 'books' table
WITH RECURSIVE counter AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id + 1 FROM counter WHERE id < 32
)
INSERT INTO books (title, author, publication_year, sales)
SELECT 
    'Title ' || id, 
    'Author ' || ((id - 1) % 5 + 1), 
    1980 + (id % 40), 
    1000 * id 
FROM counter;
