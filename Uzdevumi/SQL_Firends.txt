1.
Create a table named friends with three columns:

id that stores INTEGER
name that stores TEXT
birthday that stores DATE

2.
Beneath your current code, add Ororo Munroe to friends.

Her birthday is May 30th, 1940.

3.
Let’s make sure that Ororo has been added to the database:

SELECT * 
FROM friends;

Check for two things:

Is friends table created?
Is Ororo Munroe added to it?

4.
Let’s move on!

Add two of your friends to the table.

Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them.

5.
Ororo Munroe just realized that she can control the weather and decided to change her name. Her new name is “Storm”.

Update her record in friends.

6.
Add a new column named email.

7.
Update the email address for everyone in your table.

Storm’s email is storm@codecademy.com.

8.
Wait, Storm is fictional…

Remove her from friends.

9.
Great job! Let’s take a look at the result one last time:

SELECT * 
FROM friends;
