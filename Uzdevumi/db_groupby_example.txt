-- Creating the 'artists' table

    avg_track_rating DECIMAL(3,1) NOT NULL -- Average rating of tracks in the album, e.g., 4.5 out of 5

-- Inserting some sample data into the 'artists' table
WITH RECURSIVE artist_gen AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id + 1 FROM artist_gen WHERE id < 38

FROM artist_gen;
