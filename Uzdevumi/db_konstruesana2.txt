Orders to OrderDetails: One-to-many (An order can contain many order details, but an order detail is part of one order).

Implementation Hints:

Primary keys need to be identified for each table.
Students must determine the appropriate foreign keys (e.g., CustomerID in Orders references CustomerID in Customers).
The ProductCategories junction table should contain ProductID and CategoryID as foreign keys, ensuring that each product-category pairing is unique.
