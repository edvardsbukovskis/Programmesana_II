-- Creating the 'products' table
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    review DECIMAL(2,1) NOT NULL, -- Review out of 5, e.g., 4.3
    price DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL  -- e.g., 99.99
);

-- Inserting some sample data into the 'products' table
WITH RECURSIVE product_gen AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id + 1 FROM product_gen WHERE id < 35
)
INSERT INTO products (product_name, review, price)
SELECT 
    'Product ' || id, 
    (RANDOM() % 4 + 2) * 0.1,  -- Random review between 2.0 to 5.0
    (RANDOM() % 9900 + 100) * 0.01  -- Random price between 1.00 to 100.00
FROM product_gen;

Exercise 1:
Round the reviews of all products to 0 decimal places.

Exercise 2:
Find the product names and their prices, rounded to the nearest whole number.

Exercise 3:
Calculate the average price of all products and round it to 2 decimal places.
